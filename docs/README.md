## Project Status

### Current Demo Readiness: **70-75%**
The application works excellently for stakeholder demonstrations with its mock data implementation.

### Current Production Readiness: **0%**
The application requires significant backend integration before production deployment.

### Development Progress Tracking
See the [Implementation Plan](project-management/plan.md) for detailed task breakdown with progress checkboxes.
