The Manus platform provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with various social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. These tools allow you to perform tasks such as posting updates, managing followers, and analyzing trends. The platform also offers advanced features like sentiment analysis and image recognition. To use these features, you will need to import the 'browser' and 'shell' modules from the 'lark' library. You can then use the 'browser.post' and 'browser.get' functions to interact with social media APIs, and the 'shell' module to execute shell commands for more advanced tasks like managing files or running scripts.
